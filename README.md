### Objectives:
This project aims to assist individuals who are interested in studying abroad through the King Salman Scholarship Program, which sponsors the top 200 universities worldwide. The project provides a user-friendly tool to simplify the search process for individuals by allowing them to input their desired field of study, academic information, and test scores. The tool then generates a list of universities that are likely to accept them based on their qualifications.
The project combines machine learning techniques and data from the King Salman Scholarship Program to build a predictive model that analyzes user information and predicts universities that are likely to accept them. The model takes into account the desired field of study, academic achievements, and test scores to make accurate recommendations.
