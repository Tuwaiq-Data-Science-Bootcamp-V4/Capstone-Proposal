### Project Title:
Saudi Labor Assistant

### Group Members:
- Rayan Aloufi
- Taif Alshmarani

Since we are fresh graduates, we lack knowledge and experience regarding Saudi labor laws, making it difficult for us to ask lawyers or human resources specialists questions about the laws. We'll establish a Saudi Labor Assistant to assist employees by answering any inquiries they have about Saudi labor laws for a nominal fee.

### Dataset Description:

### The expected (Machine learning / Deep Learning) Algorithms:
