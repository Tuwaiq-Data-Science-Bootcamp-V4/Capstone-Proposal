# Capstone-Proposal



### Project Title:
Arabic Dialect and Social Meaning Detection

### Group Members:
- Abdulrahman Albaqami
- Raghad Alghofaili
- Saeed Alqahtani
- Abdullah Alturki

### Objectives:
- Develop a model that can accurately detect Arabic dialects and social meaning in text, As it is a challenging task due to the high variability of Arabic dialects and the lack of large-scale annotated datasets..
- Develop an Arabic dialect and social meaning detection model using ARBERT and MARBERT, since ARBERT and MARBERT are strong in Arabic content due to their large training datasets and their ability to capture the morphological structure of Arabic text.
- To create a really appealing design for the model website.
- To deploy the model so that it can be used efficiently.
### Dataset Description:
- The number of rows: More than 10k
- The number of columns: Undetermined
- Columns Description (meaning):
  - id : Represents the tweet id
  - sentiment : Represents the type of sentiment
  - dialect : Represents the text dialect
  - tweet : Represent the tweet text
  - will have more than the mentioned one's 
- The number of Missing values: The datasets need to be cleaned and preprocessed heavily, as they contain unwanted symbols and formatting issues, even though the number of missing values is low.

### Dataset Link:
Note: You have to choose a real dataset that needs cleaning and preprocessing.

### The expected (Machine learning / Deep Learning) Algorithms:
- GRU 
- LTSM
- MARBERT
- ARBERT

**Different algorithms may be used that are different from the mentioned one's**
  
## Final Deliverables:
- README.md file.
- Due Date: Sat, 2 Sep, at 09:00 p.m.
