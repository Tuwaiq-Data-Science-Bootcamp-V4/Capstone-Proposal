# Capstone-Proposal


## Please edit this README.md file based on your Capstone project idea.

### Project Title:
Reducing traffic caused by accidents  utilizing car dash cam.

### Group Members:
- Rayan Baghdadi
- Hussain
- Sadeem
- Hajar
- Arwa

### Objectives:
The model is designed to analyze video footage and apply algorithms to determine the responsible party in an accident. By providing this information, drivers involved can take immediate action to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance overall safety.

### Dataset Description:
Some images and videos taken from the dash cam.
