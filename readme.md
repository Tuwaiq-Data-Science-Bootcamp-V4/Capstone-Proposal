## Objectives:
Depression is a widespread and often misunderstood mental health condition that affects individuals across the globe, regardless of their age, gender, or background. In recent years, mental health awareness and understanding have grown significantly, shedding light on the prevalence and impact of depression in various countries, including Saudi Arabia.

This Depression Detection System detects the depression and recommends nearby clinics to consult a psychiatrist. Furthermore, the user must speak for 1 minute about themselves while their facial expressions are being recorded. The user must write their feelings and answer all of the questions.

## Dataset Description:
- A "Face Expression Recognition Dataset" is a collection of images or videos that are detect and recognize facial expressions or emotions displayed by individuals in images or videos.

- We have merged two datasets collected from Arabic Tweets that have been detected for depression, comprising 1859 tweets.
